# Assignment Requirements

1. Windows OS - As bat commands are being used
2. GIT Installed and Environment variable path set
3. Jenkins Installed with required JDK Setup
4. HTTP Request plugin to make rest api calls.
5. All the recommended plugins from jenkins with addition to JSON Operation plugin and File Text Opertaion plugin
6. Gmail configured with mail ID in configure section of jenkins.
7. Jenkins Job with Code from SCM GIT

## Please note that the URL provided for making rest api call is not working. Hence the stage 2 is not working as expected. Instead I have added a extra holiday.json file with random dates. The stage 2 checks the holiday.json file to get the holiday dates and matches with current date. If it matches then the build proceeds.
